## ✤ Code editor!

> This first decision will define your productivity and effectiveness as you code.

A text editor is by far the most used developer tool regardless of what type of developer you are. A good text editor can help you write better code with real-time code checking, syntax highlighting, and automatic formatting.

We recommend the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). It’s user friendly even for beginners, and is available for all major operating systems

One of the advantages of using VSCode is its ability to integrate with Git, it’s easy and fast, another thing is its ability to integrate on different teams remotely, several developers can work on the same project, or even the same code by using this tool/extension: Visual Studio Live Share helps several developers to work together more efficiently

**Pros:**

* Lightweight, and fast
* Free, Simple and Clean User Interface
* Built-in Terminal
* A huge community for support and building up extensions and additional resource
* Has best features like Git, Terminal, WebView, Live Share
* Native support for Git collaboration, open directory easily connect to Github, and no complex set up.
* Has Emmet extension, super fast HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding

## ✤ GitHub

GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site in which developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.

## ✤ Git

Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

## ✤ Web Browsers

A web browser also referred as browser is a **software application used to access information on worldwide web**. The main functionality of a browser is to retrieve web resources from the server and display it on the web browser window. The web resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, audio, videos or some other type of content. The location of the resource is specified by using a URI *(Uniform Resource Identifier)*.

A browser is made up of multiple components which come together to execute fetch a page from the database and then render it on the users' screen.

### This is how a Browser works

Web is a client/server application. *The browser is just half of it (the client)*. In the other side there must be a web server waiting for requests, which is the other half of the application.

* First the browser has to find the IP address of the web server. It asks the Operating System (OS) to translate the server name. The OS uses it's *local cache or the DNS server* if the address it's not known yet.

<br>

* After finding the IP address, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server requesting the appropriate file (web page). If no file was specified, the server responds with the "default file" (index.html, index.php, index.asp or any other that is configured in the web server). For regular web browsing, the file will be a text file formatted in HTML. But it may be any kind of file.

<br>

* After getting the requested file, the browser has two things to do: interpret and render the HTML page, and obtain the remaining objects (images, flash files, javascript files, css files, audio, video, etc.) and interpret and display them.

* Some browsers will begin to interpret and render the HTML file immediately and request the objects in parallel, filling in the objects as they are received. Others will wait to received all objects and, just then, will render and display the HTML file.

That's it. The browser will then rest waiting the user to request another file to begin everything again.
