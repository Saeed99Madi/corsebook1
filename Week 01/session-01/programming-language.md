# Introduction to Programming Languages 

During this workshop, we will cover several topics, which are:

* What is a programming language?
* Why do we need programming languages for coding?
* what programming language to learn!

One of the first things you hear when you start learning about coding are programming languages. They may sound technical and it’s hard to get a proper overview of them as a beginner. There’s just too much jargon flying around, so it’s normal to feel confused at this point.

## ✘ What is a programming language?

The most important thing you should know about programming languages is this:

**Programming languages allow us to communicate with computers through computer code.**

programming languages are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow. 

#### ✘ Why do we need programming languages for coding?

Computers *“think”* in binary — strings of 1s and 0s. Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand and write. 

A programming language is made up of a series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.

#### Low-Level vs. High-Level Programming Languages

Programming languages fall into two different classifications — **low-level and high-level**.

**Low-level programming languages** are closer to machine code, or binary. Therefore, they’re more difficult for humans to read (although they’re still easier to understand than 1s and 0s). The benefit of low-level languages is that they’re fast and offer precise control over how the computer will function.

> examples of low-level languages are assembly and machine code

**High-level programming languages** are closer to how humans communicate. High-level languages use words (like object, order, run, etc.) that are closer to the words we use in our everyday lives. This means they’re easier to program in than low-level programming languages, although they do take more time to translate into machine code for the computer.

> examples of high-level languages are JavaScript, Python and Java

## ✘ what programming language to learn! 

Most people’s journey toward learning the program starts with a single late-night Google search.

Usually, it’s something like ***“Learn ______”***

We’ll probably search for something like: ***“Which programming language should I learn first?”***

### But how do to decide which language to search for?

it’s time to decide what programming language you should choose. There are a couple routes you can go with making this decision. 
 - The first is to choose a programming language based on your goal 
 -  the second is to choose a programming language based on what’s the most in-demand or popular in the industry.

### Finding the best programming language for your goals

- Why do you want to learn a programming language? 
- Are you programming just for fun? 
- Curious about what coding is like? 
- Trying to build something specific or get a new job?

 Answering this question is a great way to get an idea of what language might be best to start with.

**Learning HTML and CSS is an excellent starting point for those who want to build websites from the ground up**. Once you are familiar with HTML/CSS, you can move on to languages like JavaScript, Node, or React to give your website the functionality it needs. 

**Want to analyze data?** SQL is a great option if you're looking for help with accessing data 

Python and R are good starting places for **data visualization**.

If you’re looking to make a career transition or get a new job, talk to people in the industry you’re interested in. If you’re interested in mobile development, web design, data science, IT, AI, or another industry, reach out to folks in those communities and ask what a typical day looks like for them. What languages do they use and what do they recommend starting with?
