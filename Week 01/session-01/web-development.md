## ♢ What is Web Development?

Web development is the act of building and maintaining websites for the internet or intranet (private network). *Examples of websites you might build would include blogs, personal pages, E-commerce sites, or social media sites.*

From the most basic, static site pages to social media platforms and applications, from e-commerce sites to content management systems (CMS); **web developers have developed every tool we use via the internet.**

**Web developers will work** with the client to understand their requirements for the website. Developers will then build, test, and deploy the site and maintain it by fixing issues and adding features.

## ♢ What Do Web Developers Do?

A Web Developer is responsible for programming code that tells websites how to operate. Web Developers typically specialize in either “front-end” (“client-side”) development or “back-end” (“server-side”) development. Some versatile and highly sought-after professionals do both, and they’re called “Full-Stack Developers.”

Web developers often work for clients who are trying to get their product or service onto the web. The work is typically very project focused and involves collaborating with a team that helps to coordinate the client’s needs into the end product. The client could be a tech company, an organization, or a government.

## What is a Full Stack Developer? Back End + Front End = Full Stack Engineer

### ♢ What is Full Stack Development?

A full stack developer is someone who works with both the front end and back end of a web application. The front end is responsible for the visual look and feel of the website, while back end is responsible for the behind the scenes logic and infrastructure of the site.

Let's take a closer look at the terms front end and back end.

### ♢ Front end Development (Client side)

Everything on a web page from the logo, to the search bar, buttons, overall layout and how the user interacts with the page was created by a front end developer. Front end developers are in charge of the look and feel of the website.

Front end developers also have to make sure the website looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, and computer screens). This is called Responsive Web Design.

### ♢ Back end Development (Server side)

Back end development refers to the part of the application that the user does not see. Back end developers focus on the logic of the site, creating servers, and working with databases and API's (Application Programming Interfaces).

For example, the content and layout for a form would be created on the client side, but when the users submits their information it gets processed on the server side (back end).

## Motivation

Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. The strongest assets you can have as a student are a desire to build, a problem-solving mind, and persistence in the face of setbacks.

The web development industry has a long history of successful developers with varying backgrounds, so people tend to care more about what you've actually built than how you got there.
