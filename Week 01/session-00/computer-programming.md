### What is computer programming?

The most important thing you should know about programming languages is this:

***Programming languages allow us to communicate with computers through computer code***.

Each programming language is simply a means to tell a computer what it should do. It’s a language your computer understands and knows how to process.

When you learn a specific programming language, it’s a lot like learning any other language. You need to understand how the language works and follow a certain set of rules, much like grammar in spoken languages.

Each language is different and you’ll use them for different types of projects. 

**Computers are stupid. Yep, that’s right!**

They only know how to follow your instructions in your code exactly how it’s written.

If there is a typo on your code, the computer won’t know what to do. Your program won’t run and you will get an error message.

That’s when your program has a bug in it.

Your computer doesn’t have any common sense to solve your mistakes by itself. It doesn’t have a mind of its own.

Remember: computers only do what we tell them to. To fix a typo in your code, you would need to write another program where you instruct the computer how to do it.

### What is coding?
**Are “coding” and “computer programming” the same thing?**

Although coding and programming are often used interchangeably, they are **not** exactly the same thing.

To be precise, coding means writing code from one language to another. For example, from English to Python.

Programming, in turn, means programming a computer (or another machine) to run a set of instructions.

So, all in all, coding is more focused on language, while programming deals with the bigger picture of making computers do what we want.

But don’t worry about mixing these two up. Everyone understands what you mean, regardless of which term you use.
