### What is the Internet?

The Internet is a **global network** of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.

You can do all of this by connecting a computer to the Internet, which is also called going online. When someone says a computer is online, it's just another way of saying it's connected to the Internet.


**Are the internet and the world wide web are the same things?**

### How Do Computers Work?

Computers, when powered off, are just costly electronic machines. They're objects consisting of a bunch of metals, plastics, and other materials.

However, once you press the power button and they have gone through their power-up process, called **booting up**, they come to life.

Your computer turns into this extremely powerful machine. It's this electronic device that gets to do complicated tasks at mind boggling speeds that would be difficult, if not impossible, for humans to do.

Their screens are vibrant and active and there's a variety of buttons and icons ready to be clicked.

### What is Binary Code and How it works?
This concept of electrical charges and the existence of only two possible states ties in nicely with the numerical system computers use in their hardware. They use it to complete every single task they are given. It's called **binary code and is made up of sequences of 0s and 1s**.

Binary code by design corresponds directly with specific machine instructions, commands, and locations in the computer's memory. The computer then reads and interprets these instructions and then carries out particular tasks.

Computers are made up of a combination of thousands of tiny physical devices that act as electrical switches, called ***transistors***.

These little electrical hardware components, the transistors, enable or disable the flow of electricity.

They can have either a positive or a negative electric charge depending on their state – that is, whether they carry electricity or don’t.

Those thousands of tiny little switches can either be **on or off**.
